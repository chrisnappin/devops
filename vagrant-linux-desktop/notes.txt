Vagrant base box includes VBox Guest Additions 5.1.20
- does not include Chef/Puppet/Ansible or ruby
cached in .vagrant

login is: vagrant/vagrant
To uncapture mouse: right control key

- manually run "sudo yum update"
- manually edited shared folder C:\\chris\\dev\\vagrant-vm => /vagrant

shared folder error:
(mount fails, dmesg is "sf_read_super_aux err=-22") 
  - cause is broken symbolic link in 5.1.20 (VBoxExtensions installed in VM) fixed in v5.1.22
  - fix is: ln -s /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-5.1.20/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions/mount.vboxsf /sbin/mount.vboxsf
  (note that /usr/lib64/VBoxGuestAdditions -> /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-5.1.20/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions)
  - have to fix for the shell provisioner to run!
  
run to force the provision step: vagrant up --provision

- had to run as root (not just prefix with sudo)
  curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | bash
(installed \bin\chef-client version 13.0.118)  
  
- note: tried installing jekyll as gem package but that requires:
  (ruby, ruby-devel, "C Development Tools and Libraries" dnf group, but then still failed)
  - Ruby gems packaged as RPMs (so don't need build tools) - see http://isitfedoraruby.com/
  
- note: save all chef cookbook files with Unix line-endings!
  
- manually installed Intellij community edition
  - downloaded Linux no-jdk (.tar.gz)
  - extract to ~
  - run bin/idea.sh (to install and to setup)
  
- for setting up .desktop files, see /usr/share/applications for examples
  (files have .desktop suffix, and need to be executable)
- installed Tweak Tool, set desktop icons on, reduced window fonts from 11 to 10 points

- AWS
  - already had Python 2.7.13
  - ran: pip install --upgrade --user awscli  
  (installs to ~/.local/bin)
